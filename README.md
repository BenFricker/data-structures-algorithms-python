### Algorithms

#### **[Pathfinding Algorithms](algorithms/pathfinding.py)**
Classic graph search and shortest path algorithms on directed weighted graphs

**1. Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- **Purpose:** Find shortest path in weighted graphs
- **Method:** Uniform cost search, expands lowest cost nodes first
- **Implementation:** Uses linear scan for minimum distance vertex (O(V¬≤))
- **Use Cases:** GPS navigation, network routing, game AI
- **Time Complexity:** O(V¬≤) with linear scan; O((V + E) log V) possible with binary heap
- **Guarantees:** Optimal shortest path (non-negative weights)

**Why O(V¬≤):** This implementation uses a simple linear scan to find the minimum distance vertex in each iteration. While a binary min-heap could optimize this to O((V + E) log V), the O(V¬≤) approach has less overhead and is more suitable for small to medium-sized graphs with simpler implementation.

**2. A* (A-Star) Algorithm**
- **Purpose:** Efficient shortest path with heuristics
- **Method:** Uses Euclidean distance heuristic: `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`
  - `g(n)`: Cost from start to current node
  - `h(n)`: Estimated cost from current to goal (Euclidean distance)
- **Use Cases:** Game pathfinding, robotics navigation, route planning
- **Time Complexity:** O((V + E) log V) with priority queue
- **Advantage:** Dramatically more efficient than Dijkstra's with good heuristics

**Heuristic Properties:**
- **Admissible:** The Euclidean distance heuristic never overestimates the actual cost (straight-line distance is always the shortest possible)
- **Consistent:** Satisfies the triangle inequality h(u) ‚â§ cost(u,v) + h(v), guaranteeing that estimated costs never decrease along any path
- **Optimal:** These properties ensure A* finds the optimal path while expanding far fewer nodes than Dijkstra's

**3. Depth-First Search (DFS) - Longest Path**
- **Purpose:** Find longest path in weighted directed graphs
- **Method:** Exhaustive recursive exploration with backtracking
- **Strategy:** Explores all simple paths from start to goal, maintaining a visited set to prevent cycles while allowing vertices in different paths
- **Time Complexity:** O(V!) in worst case (exponential)
- **Space Complexity:** O(V) for recursion stack and visited set
- **Note:** NP-hard problem - fundamentally different from shortest path problems which have optimal substructure

**Why Longest Path is Hard:** Unlike shortest path problems that can use dynamic programming or greedy approaches, finding the longest simple path requires exploring all possible paths. In a dense graph, there can be up to V! distinct simple paths between two vertices, making this an exponential-time problem.

**Priority Queue Implementation:**
- Custom min-heap data structure for efficient pathfinding
- O(log n) insert and extract operations
- Essential for A*'s guided search strategy

---

### Heaps

#### **[Max Heap](heaps/max_heap.py)**

- **Operations:** Insert, Extract-Max, Heapify
- **Use Cases:** Priority queues, heap sort, task scheduling
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Insert: O(log n)
  - Extract-Max: O(log n)
  - Heapify: O(n)

## üìä Performance Analysis

### Dijkstra's vs A* Algorithm Comparison

**Test Case:** 20 vertices, 100 edges, Start: vertex 2, Goal: vertex 13

| Algorithm | Path Found | Path Length | Nodes Expanded | Efficiency |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| **Dijkstra's** | 2 ‚Üí 13 | 85.000 | 20 | Baseline |
| **A*** | 2 ‚Üí 13 | 85.000 | 2 | **90% reduction!** |

### Key Insights

**Why A* Outperforms Dijkstra's:**

A* uses the Euclidean distance heuristic h(n) to intelligently prioritize vertices that are closer to the goal, dramatically reducing the search space while still guaranteeing an optimal path. Dijkstra's algorithm explores uniformly in all directions without considering the goal location, making it less efficient when a good heuristic is available.

**Real-World Impact:** In this test case, A* achieved the same optimal path while expanding only 2 nodes compared to Dijkstra's 20 nodes - a 90% reduction in computational work. This efficiency gain becomes even more pronounced in larger graphs.

**Both algorithms guarantee optimality:** The key difference is efficiency. A* provides the best of both worlds - optimal pathfinding with significantly fewer node expansions when a good heuristic is available.

### DFS Longest Path Results

**Test Case:** Same graph (20 vertices, 100 edges)

**Result:**
- Longest Path: 2 ‚Üí 17 ‚Üí 9 ‚Üí 16 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 18 ‚Üí 14 ‚Üí 8 ‚Üí 6 ‚Üí 19 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 12 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 15 ‚Üí 11 ‚Üí 7 ‚Üí 10 ‚Üí 13
- Path Length: 1595.000
- Demonstrates exponential exploration of all simple paths between vertices

**Performance Note:** Successfully found the longest simple path through exhaustive exploration, showcasing the exponential nature of this NP-Hard problem.

## üìä Complexity Analysis

### Data Structure Complexities

| Data Structure | Insert | Delete | Search | Space |
|---------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Stack** | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) | O(n) |
| **Queue** | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) | O(n) |
| **Binary Search Tree** | O(log n)* | O(log n)* | O(log n)* | O(n) |
| **Max Heap** | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(n) | O(n) |
| **Adjacency List** | O(1) | O(1) | O(V+E) | O(V+E) |

*Average case for balanced tree; worst case O(n) for unbalanced

### Algorithm Complexities

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| **BFS** | O(V + E) | O(V) | Level-by-level traversal |
| **DFS** | O(V + E) | O(V) | Deep exploration |
| **Dijkstra's** | O(V¬≤) or O((V + E) log V) | O(V) | O(V¬≤) with linear scan; O((V+E) log V) with heap |
| **A*** | O((V + E) log V) | O(V) | Dramatically fewer expansions with good heuristic |
| **DFS Longest Path** | O(V!) | O(V) | NP-Hard; exponential worst case |

### Complexity Insights

**Dijkstra's O(V¬≤) vs O((V + E) log V):**
Our implementation uses a linear scan to find the minimum distance vertex, resulting in O(V¬≤) complexity. While this could be optimized to O((V + E) log V) using a binary min-heap for the candidate set (reducing minimum-finding from O(V) to O(log V)), the simpler O(V¬≤) approach:
- Has less implementation overhead
- Performs comparably for small-to-medium graphs
- Is more straightforward to understand and debug

For the sample graph (20 vertices, 100 edges), both approaches have similar practical performance.

**A* Optimality and Efficiency:**
A* achieves O((V + E) log V) time complexity through its priority queue implementation, which retrieves the lowest f(n) vertex in O(log V) time. Every vertex is processed once (O(V log V)) and all edges are inspected when enqueuing neighbors (O(E log V)), resulting in O((V + E) log V) total complexity. The key advantage: A* expands far fewer nodes in practice while maintaining optimality.

**Why Longest Path is Exponential:**
Finding the longest simple path is fundamentally different from shortest path problems:
- **Shortest path:** Has optimal substructure, enabling dynamic programming/greedy approaches
- **Longest path:** Lacks optimal substructure - the longest path to an intermediate vertex doesn't guarantee the overall longest path
- **Result:** Must exhaustively explore all simple paths (up to V! in dense graphs), making it NP-Hard

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Structures & Design Decisions

### Strategic Design Choices

Each data structure was carefully selected to optimize the algorithm's critical operations:

#### **1. Dictionary (Hash Map)**
**Used in:** Dijkstra's and A* for distance/parent tracking

**Why:**
- O(1) average-case insertion, update, and lookup operations
- Critical for efficient path reconstruction via parent pointers
- Essential during path exploration for quick distance lookups

**Impact:** Enables fast tracking of shortest distances and path reconstruction without introducing algorithmic bottlenecks.

#### **2. Set**
**Used in:** Dijkstra's (candidate_set), A* and DFS (visited_set)

**Why:**
- O(1) average-case membership testing
- O(1) insertion and deletion operations
- Perfect for tracking which vertices have been processed

**Impact:** Prevents redundant work, avoids infinite loops, and enables efficient "have we seen this vertex?" checks that are crucial for correctness.

#### **3. Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**
**Used in:** A* algorithm for vertex ordering

**Why:**
- O(log V) extraction of minimum f(n) vertex
- Automatically maintains vertices in priority order
- Enables A*'s guided search strategy

**Impact:** This is what makes A* dramatically more efficient than Dijkstra's. By always exploring the most promising vertex first (lowest f(n) = g(n) + h(n)), A* reduces the search space by up to 90% while maintaining optimality.

#### **4. List**
**Used in:** Path reconstruction (A*, Dijkstra's), current path tracking (DFS)

**Why:**
- O(1) append/pop operations at the end
- Maintains ordered sequence of vertices
- Simple and efficient for incremental path building

**Impact:** Perfect for reconstructing the final path by following parent pointers backward, then reversing. In DFS, enables efficient backtracking during recursive exploration.

### Design Philosophy

**Efficiency where it matters:** Data structures are chosen to optimize the most frequent operations in each algorithm. For example, A*'s priority queue optimizes "find minimum f(n)" which happens V times, while simple lists handle the final path reconstruction that happens only once.

**Simplicity with purpose:** Where multiple options exist (e.g., Dijkstra's linear scan vs heap), the simpler approach is chosen when performance differences are negligible for the target graph sizes. This makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand without sacrificing practical performance.
