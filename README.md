## üéØ Overview

This repository contains educational implementations of essential data structures and algorithms, built to demonstrate deep understanding of computer science fundamentals. All implementations prioritize clarity, correctness, and educational value while maintaining efficient algorithmic complexity.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Core data structures (trees, graphs, heaps, queues, stacks)
- Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, pathfinding)
- Advanced search algorithms (Dijkstra's, A*)
- Custom implementations without external dependencies

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Implementations

### Linear Data Structures

#### **[Stack](linear/stack.py)**
LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure
- **Operations:** Push, Pop, Peek
- **Use Cases:** Function call stack, undo mechanisms, expression evaluation
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) for all operations

#### **[Queue](linear/queue.py)**
FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure
- **Operations:** Enqueue, Dequeue
- **Use Cases:** BFS, task scheduling, buffer management
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) for all operations

---

### Trees

#### **[Binary Search Tree](trees/binary_search_tree.py)**
Ordered binary tree maintaining BST property
- **Operations:** Insert, Delete, Search, In-order Traversal
- **Features:**
  - Handles all deletion cases (leaf, one child, two children)
  - Duplicate prevention
  - Recursive traversal methods
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Average: O(log n) for insert, delete, search
  - Worst: O(n) for unbalanced tree

**Key Implementation Details:**
```python
# Deletion handles 4 cases:
# 1. Leaf node - Simple removal
# 2. One left child - Replace with left child
# 3. One right child - Replace with right child  
# 4. Two children - Replace with in-order successor
```

---

### Graphs

#### **[Adjacency List](graphs/adjacency_list.py)**
Efficient sparse graph representation
- **Features:**
  - Vertex and edge management
  - Weighted edge support
  - Custom Queue and Stack implementations
- **Algorithms Included:**
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - Level-by-level traversal
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - Deep exploration traversal
- **Space Complexity:** O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges

**Graph Structure:**
```python
# Adjacency List stores neighbors for each vertex
# Vertex 1: [2, 3]  (connected to vertices 2 and 3)
# Vertex 2: [4]     (connected to vertex 4)
```

### Algorithms

#### **[Pathfinding Algorithms](algorithms/pathfinding.py)**
Classic graph search and shortest path algorithms on directed weighted graphs

**1. Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- **Purpose:** Find shortest path in weighted graphs
- **Method:** Uniform cost search, expands lowest cost nodes first
- **Use Cases:** GPS navigation, network routing, game AI
- **Time Complexity:** O((V + E) log V) with priority queue
- **Guarantees:** Optimal shortest path (non-negative weights)

**2. A* (A-Star) Algorithm**
- **Purpose:** Efficient shortest path with heuristics
- **Method:** Uses Euclidean distance heuristic: `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`
  - `g(n)`: Cost from start to current node
  - `h(n)`: Estimated cost from current to goal
- **Use Cases:** Game pathfinding, robotics navigation, route planning
- **Time Complexity:** O(E) in best case, O(V¬≤) in worst case
- **Advantage:** More efficient than Dijkstra's with good heuristics

**3. Depth-First Search (DFS) - Longest Path**
- **Purpose:** Find longest path in weighted directed graphs
- **Method:** Exhaustive recursive exploration with backtracking
- **Time Complexity:** O(V!) in worst case (exponential)
- **Note:** NP-hard problem, suitable for small graphs

**Priority Queue Implementation:**
- Min-heap data structure for efficient pathfinding
- O(log n) insert and extract operations

---

### Heaps

#### **[Max Heap](heaps/max_heap.py)**
Complete binary tree maintaining max-heap property
- **Operations:** Insert, Extract-Max, Heapify
- **Use Cases:** Priority queues, heap sort, task scheduling
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Insert: O(log n)
  - Extract-Max: O(log n)
  - Heapify: O(n)

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Example - Binary Search Tree

```python
from trees.binary_search_tree import BinarySearchTree

# Create tree
tree = BinarySearchTree()

# Insert values
tree.insert(50)
tree.insert(30)
tree.insert(70)
tree.insert(20)
tree.insert(40)

# Search for value
result = tree.find(30)
print(result.content)  # Output: 30

# In-order traversal (sorted order)
tree.in_order_traversal()  # Output: 20 30 40 50 70

# Delete node
tree.delete(30)
tree.in_order_traversal()  # Output: 20 40 50 70
```

### Graph Pathfinding Example

```python
from algorithms.pathfinding import DirectedWeightedGraph

# Create graph
graph = DirectedWeightedGraph()

# Add vertices with coordinates
graph.add_vertex(1, 0, 0)
graph.add_vertex(2, 1, 1)
graph.add_vertex(3, 2, 0)

# Add weighted edges
graph.add_edge(1, 2, 5.0)
graph.add_edge(2, 3, 3.0)
graph.add_edge(1, 3, 10.0)

# Find shortest path using Dijkstra's
path, distance, nodes = graph.dijkstras_algorithm(1, 3)
print(f"Shortest path: {path}")      # [1, 2, 3]
print(f"Distance: {distance}")       # 8.0
print(f"Nodes explored: {nodes}")    # 3

# Find shortest path using A*
path, distance, nodes = graph.astar_algorithm(1, 3)
print(f"A* path: {path}")            # [1, 2, 3]
print(f"A* distance: {distance}")    # 8.0
print(f"A* nodes: {nodes}")          # 2 (more efficient!)
```

### Adjacency List Graph Example

```python
from graphs.adjacency_list import Graph

# Create graph
g = Graph()

# Add vertices
for v in ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']:
    g.add_vertex(v)

# Add edges
g.add_edge('A', 'B', 1)
g.add_edge('A', 'C', 1)
g.add_edge('B', 'D', 1)

# Breadth-First Search
g.Breadth_First_Search('A')
# Output: Visited: A, Visited: B, Visited: C, Visited: D

# Depth-First Search
g.depth_first_search('A')
# Output: Visited: A, Visited: C, Visited: B, Visited: D
```
